\description{
Simulates random draws (reaction times and choices) from a two-choice Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) model.

In this parametrization, each accumulator has its own independent drift rate distribution:
\itemize{
\item Accumulator 0 has drift drawn from N(driftzero, sigmazero^2).
\item Accumulator 1 has drift drawn from N(driftone, sigmaone^2).
}

For each trial, drift rates are sampled on an individual basis until at least one of the two is positive.
The starting point for each accumulator is sampled uniformly from (0, sigmabias). The decision threshold is defined as sigmabias + bs.
The decision time for an accumulator is calculated as (b - start)/drift, and if its drift is not positive, its decision time is set to Inf.
The winning accumulator (the one whose decision time is minimal) determines the response, and the final reaction time is the sum of its decision time
and a fixed non-decision time (ndt).

\details{
\strong{Psychological Interpretation:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Drift Rate (\code{driftzero}, \code{driftone})}: Reflects the rate at which evidence accumulates for each choice. Higher drift rates indicate faster
evidence accumulation and a higher likelihood of selecting the corresponding choice. Differences in drift rates between accumulators
can represent differences in preference, difficulty, or bias between the two options.
\item \strong{Drift Rate Variability (\code{sigmazero}, \code{sigmaone})}: Captures trial-to-trial variability in the evidence accumulation process.
Higher variability indicates less consistent evidence accumulation, leading to greater variability in reaction times and choices.
\item \strong{Start Point Variability (\code{sigmabias})}: Represents the range of initial evidence levels for each accumulator. Larger values of \code{sigmabias} introduce
more variability in reaction times, as the starting point can vary more widely between trials.
\item \strong{Threshold (\code{b = sigmabias + bs})}: Boundary separation (\code{bs}). Represents the amount of evidence required to make a decision. Higher thresholds lead to longer reaction times
but more accurate decisions, as more evidence is required before a choice is made.
\item \strong{Non-Decision Time (\code{ndt})}: Accounts for processes unrelated to evidence accumulation, such as sensory encoding and motor response.
This parameter shifts all reaction times by a constant amount.
