\value{
A data frame with \code{n} rows and columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{rt}: Simulated reaction time.
\item \code{response}: The index (0 or 1) of the winning accumulator/choice.
}
}
\description{
Simulates random draws (reaction times and choices) from a two-choice Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) model.
This version uses a parameterization where the second accumulator's parameters are defined relative to the first.
The LBA model assumes that evidence for each choice option accumulates linearly and independently
until one accumulator reaches a threshold. The start point of accumulation is variable, drawn
from a uniform distribution \verb{[0, A]}. Drift rates are also variable, drawn from a normal distribution.

\details{
The LBA model assumes that evidence for each choice option accumulates linearly and independently
until one accumulator reaches a threshold. The start point of accumulation is variable, drawn
from a uniform distribution \verb{[0, A]}. Drift rates are also variable, drawn from a normal distribution.

The simulation follows the standard LBA process:
\enumerate{
\item For each trial:
\itemize{
\item Sample drift rates \code{rate_0} from \code{Normal(vzero, sigmazero)} and \code{rate_1} from \code{Normal(vzero + vdelta, sigmazero * exp(sigmadelta))}.
\item Sample start points \code{start_0} and \code{start_1} from \code{Uniform(0, A)}.
}
\item Resample drift rates for a trial if \emph{both} sampled rates are non-positive (<= 0).
\item Calculate the time \code{dt_i} for each accumulator to reach the threshold \code{b = A + k}: \code{dt_i = (b - start_i) / rate_i}. If \code{rate_i <= 0}, \code{dt_i} is effectively infinity.
\item The accumulator with the minimum positive \code{dt_i} determines the choice (\code{response}) and the decision time (\code{min(dt_i)}).
\item The final reaction time is \code{rt = min(dt_i) + ndt}.
}

\strong{Psychological Interpretation:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Drift Rate (\code{vzero}, \code{vdelta})}: Reflects the rate at which evidence accumulates for each choice. Higher drift rates indicate faster
evidence accumulation and a higher likelihood of selecting the corresponding choice. Differences in drift rates between accumulators
(via \code{vdelta}) can represent differences in preference, difficulty, or bias between the two options.
\item \strong{Drift Rate Variability (\code{sigmazero}, \code{sigmadelta})}: Captures trial-to-trial variability in the evidence accumulation process.
Higher variability indicates less consistent evidence accumulation, leading to greater variability in reaction times and choices.
\item \strong{Start Point Variability (\code{A})}: Represents the range of initial evidence levels for each accumulator. Larger values of \code{A} introduce
more variability in reaction times, as the starting point can vary more widely between trials.
\item \strong{Threshold (\code{b = A + k})}: Represents the amount of evidence required to make a decision. Higher thresholds lead to longer reaction times
but more accurate decisions, as more evidence is required before a choice is made.
\item \strong{Non-Decision Time (\code{ndt})}: Accounts for processes unrelated to evidence accumulation, such as sensory encoding and motor response.
This parameter shifts all reaction times by a constant amount.
}

\strong{Special Cases:}
\itemize{
\item When \code{vdelta = 0} and \code{sigmadelta = 0}, the two accumulators are symmetric, meaning both choices are equally likely (assuming no bias in the start points or thresholds).
\item When \code{A} is small relative to \code{k}, the model behaves more deterministically, as the start point variability has less influence on reaction times.
\item When \code{sigmazero} or \code{sigmadelta} are large, the model produces more variable reaction times and less predictable choices.
