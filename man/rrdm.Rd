\usage{
rrdm(n, vzero, vone, bs, bias, ndt)

drdm(x, vzero, vone, bs, bias, ndt, log = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of trials to simulate. Must be a positive integer.}

\item{vzero}{Drift rate for the first accumulator. Must be a single non-negative number.}

\item{vone}{Drift rate for the second accumulator. Must be a single non-negative number.
At least one of \code{vzero} or \code{vone} must be positive.}

\item{bs}{Threshold parameter, defined as \code{bs = b - bias}, where \code{b} is the
decision threshold and \code{bias} is the maximum starting point. Must be a single
positive number.}

\item{bias}{Maximum starting point parameter. The starting point for each
accumulator on each trial is drawn from \code{Uniform(0, bias)}. Must be a single
positive number.}

\item{ndt}{Non-decision time (encoding and motor time offset). Must be a
single non-negative number.}

\item{x}{Vector of quantiles (observed reaction times).}

\item{log}{Logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p).}
}
\value{
bias data frame with \code{n} rows and two columns:
\item{rt}{The simulated reaction time (minimum finishing time across the two accumulators).}
\item{choice}{The index of the winning accumulator (1 for \code{vzero}, 2 for \code{vone}).}

\description{
Simulates choice reaction times from a two-accumulator Racing Diffusion Model (RDM).
This is a specialized version where exactly two accumulators race towards a
common threshold. The model assumes variability in the starting point of the
diffusion process, drawn from a uniform distribution. This version is optimized
for performance using vectorized operations and allows one (but not both)
drift rate to be zero.
}
\details{
The RDM implemented here follows the formulation where the two accumulators
have drift rates \code{vzero} and \code{vone}. The diffusion process starts at a point \code{z} drawn
from \code{Uniform(0, bias)}. The process terminates when either accumulator reaches
a threshold \code{b}. The parameter \code{bs} is defined as \code{bs = b - bias}, representing
the distance from the maximum starting point \code{bias} to the threshold \code{b}.
Therefore, the effective distance to threshold for a given trial is
\code{bs = b - z = bs + bias - z}.

The finishing time for a single accumulator, given its drift rate \code{v}, \code{bs}, \code{bias}, and \code{ndt},
is simulated by:
\enumerate{
\item Sampling a starting point \code{z ~ Uniform(0, bias)}.
\item Calculating the distance \code{bs = bs + bias - z}.
\item If \code{v > 0}, simulating the time to reach \code{bs} from an Inverse Gaussian distribution
with mean \code{bs / v} and shape \code{bs^2}. This simulation uses an
internal implementation based on Michael et al. (1976).
\item If \code{v = 0}, the finishing time is considered infinite (\code{Inf}).
\item Adding the non-decision time \code{ndt} to finite finishing times.
}

The function simulates this process for both accumulators using vectorized operations.
The accumulator that finishes first determines the choice (1 for \code{vzero}, 2 for \code{vone})
and the reaction time (RT) for that trial. If one drift rate is zero, the
accumulator with the positive drift rate will always win.
