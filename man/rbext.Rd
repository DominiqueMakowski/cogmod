\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of simulated trials. Must be a positive integer.}

\description{
The ordered beta model (\href{https://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2022.20}{Kubinec, 2023}) was
introduced as an appropriate and parsimonious way of describing data commonly
observed in psychological science (such as from slider scales). It is defined
with a Beta distribution on the interval 0-1 with additional point masses at 0 and 1.

The BeXt model corresponds to a reparametrized ordered beta model.
Instead of defining the left and right cutpoints, the BeXt parametrization
uses the likelihood of extreme values (0 and 1) and their balance (i.e., the
relative proportion of zeros and ones).

It differs from the Zero-One-Inflated Beta (ZOIB) model in that the ZOIB model has \code{zoi}
and \code{coi} parameters, directly controlling the likelihood of extreme values. Instead,
BeXt uses \code{pex} and \code{bex} to define "cutpoints" after which extreme values become likely.

# Simulate data with different parameterizations
x <- rbext(10000, mu = 0.5, phi = 3, pex = 0.05, bex = 0.5)
hist(x, breaks = 50, main = "Simulated Outcomes", xlab = "y")
x <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 1001)
densities <- dbext(x, mu = 0.5, phi = 5, pex = 0.2, bex = 0.5)
plot(x, densities, type = "l", main = "Density Function", xlab = "y", ylab = "Density")
