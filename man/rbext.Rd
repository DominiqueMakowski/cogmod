\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of simulated values. Must be a positive integer.}

\item{mu}{Mean of the continuous Beta component (between 0 and 1), represents the central
tendency of non-extreme values.}

\item{phi}{Precision parameter (positive). Note: This corresponds to half of the "typical"
precision parameter used in Beta models (internally, \code{precision = phi * 2} is used).
This reparametrization means \code{phi = 1} (with \code{mu = 0.5}) corresponds to a uniform distribution
between 0 and 1 for the Beta component. It facilitates the usage of priors (e.g., on a log-link,
\code{log(phi) = 0} corresponds to this uniform case).}

\item{pex}{Overall probability of extreme values (0 or 1). \verb{0 <= pex <= 1}.}

\item{bex}{Balances the extreme probability mass between 0 and 1. If \code{bex = 0.5}, the mass
is distributed equally (\code{P(0) = P(1) = pex / 2}). If \code{bex > 0.5}, more mass goes to 0.
If \code{bex < 0.5}, more mass goes to 1. Specifically, \code{P(0) = pex * (1 - bex)} and \code{P(1) = pex * bex}.}

\item{x}{Vector of quantiles (values at which to evaluate the density). Must be between 0 and 1, inclusive.}

\item{log}{Logical; if TRUE, returns the log-density.}

\item{link_mu, link_phi, link_pex, link_bex}{Link functions for the parameters.}

\item{i, prep}{For brms' functions to run: index of the observation and a \code{brms} preparation object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}
}
\value{
A vector of simulated outcomes in the range 0-1.

\description{
The BEXT model represents subjective ratings as a mixture of a continuous Beta distribution
with additional point masses at the extremes (0 and 1). This structure effectively captures
common patterns in subjective rating data where respondents often select extreme values
at higher rates than would be expected from a Beta distribution alone.

The BeXt model corresponds to a reparametrized ordered beta model (\href{https://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2022.20}{Kubinec, 2023}),
which was introduced as an appropriate and parsimonious way of describing data commonly
observed in psychological science (such as from slider scales). It is defined
with a Beta distribution on the interval 0-1 with additional point masses at 0 and 1.

It differs from the Zero-One-Inflated Beta (ZOIB) model in that the ZOIB model has \code{zoi}
and \code{coi} parameters, directly controlling the likelihood of extreme values. Instead,
BeXt uses \code{pex} and \code{bex} to define "cutpoints" after which extreme values become likely.
In an ordered beta framework, the boundary probabilities arise through a single underlying
ordering process (the location of the cutpoints on the latent scale). In a ZOIB framework,
the boundaries are more like additional mass points inserted into a beta distribution.
In ordered beta models, the parameters represent a coherent underlying latent process.
Having cutpoints interact with mu better represents a single unified psychological process.

The BEXT model changes the parameterization of the ordered beta model to be more interpretable:
Instead of using fixed cutpoints, this version computes the cutpoints from two intuitive parameters:
\itemize{
\item \code{pex} (p-extreme): the overall probability of extreme values (0 or 1).
\item \code{bex} (balance-extreme): the balance of extreme probability mass between 0 and 1.
Because these parameters directly map onto the expected proportion of responses at the extremes,
this approach provides greater flexibility (e.g., in capturing pronounced endpoints: It can adapt
to various shapes - such as extreme clustering at zero or one) and intuitive interpretability.

\details{
The BeXt model corresponds to a reparametrized ordered beta model.
Instead of defining the left and right cutpoints directly, the BeXt parametrization
uses the overall probability of extreme values (\code{pex}) and their balance (\code{bex}).

The probability masses at the extremes are determined by:
\itemize{
\item Probability mass at 0: \code{P(0) = pex * (1 - bex)}
\item Probability mass at 1: \code{P(1) = pex * bex}
The probability of a value falling between 0 and 1 (drawn from the Beta distribution) is \code{1 - pex}.
}

\strong{Special cases:}
\itemize{
\item When \code{pex = 0}: Pure Beta distribution with mean \code{mu} and precision \code{phi * 2}.
\item When \code{pex = 1}: Pure Bernoulli distribution with \code{P(1) = bex}, \code{P(0) = 1-bex}.
\item When \code{bex = 0} and \code{pex = 1}: All mass at 0.
\item When \code{bex = 1} and \code{pex = 1}: All mass at 1.
}

\strong{Psychological Interpretation:}
\itemize{
\item \code{mu}: Can be interpreted as the underlying average tendency or preference strength,
disregarding extreme "all-or-nothing" responses.
\item \code{phi}: Reflects the certainty or consistency of the non-extreme responses. Higher \code{phi}
indicates responses tightly clustered around \code{mu} (more certainty), while lower \code{phi}
(especially \code{phi = 1}) suggests more uniform or uncertain responses.
\item \code{pex}: Represents the overall tendency towards extreme responding (choosing 0 or 1).
This could reflect individual response styles (e.g., acquiescence, yea-saying/nay-saying)
or properties of the item itself (e.g., polarizing questions).
\item \code{bex}: Indicates the \emph{direction} of the extreme response bias. \code{bex > 0.5} suggests a bias
towards the upper anchor (1), while \code{bex < 0.5} suggests a bias towards the lower anchor (0).
