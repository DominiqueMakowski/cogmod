\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of simulated trials.}

\item{p}{Proportion parameter determining the balance between the left and right sides
\emph{after excluding} the probability mass at the middle (\code{pmid}). \verb{P(Right Side | Not Middle) = p}.}

\item{confright, confleft}{Mean parameter (\code{mu}) for the underlying Beta-Gate distribution for the
\emph{right} side and \emph{left} side, respectively. Represents confidence towards 1. \verb{0 < confright < 1}.}

\item{precright, precleft}{Precision parameter (\code{phi}) for the underlying Beta-Gate distribution for
the \emph{right} side and \emph{left} side, respectively. Must be positive. Higher values indicate more
concentrated distributions, and a value of 1 corresponds to a uniform distribution.}

\item{pex}{Controls the location of the lower and upper boundary gates (\verb{0 <= pex <= 1}). It defines
the total probability mass allocated to the extremes (0 or 1).  Higher \code{pex} increases the probability
of extreme values (0 or 1).}

\item{bex}{Balances the extreme probability mass \code{pex} between 0 and 1 (\verb{0 <= bex <= 1}). A balance
of \code{0.5} means that the 'gates' are symmetrically placed around the center of the distribution, and
values higher or lower than \code{0.5} will shift the relative "ease" of crossing the gates towards 1
or 0, respectively.}

\item{pmid}{Probability mass exactly at the \code{mid}. This determines the proportion
of trials where the output is directly assigned the value of \code{mid}, bypassing
the left or right components.}

\item{mid}{The point dividing the scale (\verb{0 < mid < 1}). Typically set to 0.5. Note that in the Stan implementation,
\code{mid} is fixed at 0.5 and not available as a parameter.}

\item{x}{Vector of quantiles (values at which to evaluate the density). Must be between 0 and 1, inclusive.}

\item{log}{Logical; if TRUE, returns the log-density.}

\item{link_mu, link_confright, link_precright, link_confleft, link_precleft, link_pex, link_bex, link_pmid}{Link functions for the parameters.}

\item{i, prep}{For brms' functions to run: index of the observation and a \code{brms} preparation object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}

\description{
Simulates data from the Choice-Confidence (CHOCO) model. This model is useful for
subjective ratings (e.g., Likert-type scales) where responses represent a choice
between two underlying categories (e.g., "disagree" vs. "agree") along with a
degree of confidence or intensity.

The CHOCO model divides the response scale at a middle-value. Responses above and below the
middle are modeled by two rescaled (and mirrored for the left side) \link[=rbetagate]{Beta-Gate} distributions.
In Beta-Gate distributions, extreme values (0 or 1) are generated by the "lumping" of values
that crossed a threshold (or "gate"). The location of these gates from the center of the
distribution is controlled by the \code{pex} and \code{bex} parameters, influecing the ease of crossing
the gate (and thus the probability of extreme values).
}
\details{
\strong{Psychological Interpretation:}
\itemize{
\item \code{p}: Represents the overall tendency to choose the "right" category (e.g., "agree") over the "left"
category (e.g., "disagree"), given that a choice is made (i.e., not responding exactly at \code{mid}).
\item \code{confright} and \code{confleft}: Average confidence level when choosing the "right" or "left" category.
Higher values (closer to 1) indicate stronger confidence or agreement towards the extreme end of the
scale.
\item \code{precright} and \code{precleft}: Certainty or consistency of the confidence ratings for the right and left
choices, respectively. Higher values indicate less variability in confidence ratings around their
respective means (\code{confright}, \code{confleft}).
\item \code{pex}: Represents the overall tendency towards extreme responding (choosing 0 or 1).
This could reflect individual response styles (e.g., acquiescence, yea-saying/nay-saying)
or properties of the item itself (e.g., polarizing questions).
\item \code{bex}: Indicates the \emph{direction} of the extreme response bias. \code{bex > 0.5} suggests a bias
for producing ones more easily, while \code{bex < 0.5} suggests a bias towards zero.
