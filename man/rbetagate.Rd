\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of simulated values.}

\item{mu}{Mean of the underlying Beta distribution (0 < mu < 1).}

\item{phi}{Precision parameter of the underlying Beta distribution (phi > 0).
Note: \code{precision = phi * 2}. \code{phi = 1} corresponds to uniform when \code{mu = 0.5}.}

\item{pex}{Controls the location of the lower and upper boundary gates (\verb{0 <= pex <= 1}). It defines
the total probability mass allocated to the extremes (0 or 1).  Higher \code{pex} increases the probability
of extreme values (0 or 1).}

\item{bex}{Balances the extreme probability mass \code{pex} between 0 and 1 (\verb{0 <= bex <= 1}). A balance
of \code{0.5} means that the 'gates' are symmetrically placed around the center of the distribution, and
values higher or lower than \code{0.5} will shift the relative "ease" of crossing the gates towards 1
or 0, respectively.}

\item{x}{Vector of quantiles (values at which to evaluate the density). Must be between 0 and 1, inclusive.}

\item{log}{Logical; if TRUE, returns the log-density.}

\item{link_mu, link_phi, link_pex, link_bex}{Link functions for the parameters.}

\item{i, prep}{For brms' functions to run: index of the observation and a \code{brms} preparation object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}
}
\value{
A vector of simulated outcomes in the range 0-1.

\description{
The Beta-Gate model represents subjective ratings as a mixture of a continuous Beta distribution
with additional point masses at the extremes (0 and 1). This structure effectively captures
common patterns in subjective rating data where respondents often select extreme values
at higher rates than would be expected from a Beta distribution alone.

The Beta-Gate model corresponds to a reparametrized ordered beta model (\href{https://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2022.20}{Kubinec, 2023}).
In the ordered Beta model, the extreme values (0 and 1) arise from censoring an underlying
latent process based on cutpoints ("gates"). Values falling past the gates are considered extremes
(zeros and ones). The difference from the Ordered Beta is the way the cutpoints are defined,
as well as the scale of the precision parameter phi.

It differs from the Zero-One-Inflated Beta (ZOIB) model in that the ZOIB model has \code{zoi}
and \code{coi} parameters, directly controlling the likelihood of extreme values. Instead,
Beta-Gate uses \code{pex} and \code{bex} to define "cutpoints" after which extreme values become likely.
In an ordered beta framework, the boundary probabilities arise through a single underlying
ordering process (the location of the cutpoints on the latent scale). In a ZOIB framework,
the boundaries are more like additional mass points inserted into a beta distribution.
In Beta-gate models, extreme values arise naturally from thresholding a single latent process.

\details{
\strong{Special cases:}
\itemize{
\item When \code{pex = 0}: Pure Beta distribution with mean \code{mu} and precision \code{phi * 2}.
\item When \code{pex = 1}: Pure Bernoulli distribution with \code{P(1) = bex}, \code{P(0) = 1-bex}.
\item When \code{bex = 0} and \code{pex = 1}: All mass at 0.
\item When \code{bex = 1} and \code{pex = 1}: All mass at 1.
}

\strong{Psychological Interpretation:}
\itemize{
\item \code{mu}: Can be interpreted as the underlying average tendency or preference strength,
disregarding extreme "all-or-nothing" responses.
\item \code{phi}: Reflects the certainty or consistency of the non-extreme responses. Higher \code{phi}
indicates responses tightly clustered around \code{mu} (more certainty), while lower \code{phi}
(especially \code{phi = 1}) suggests more uniform or uncertain responses.
\item \code{pex}: Represents the overall tendency towards extreme responding (choosing 0 or 1).
This could reflect individual response styles (e.g., acquiescence, yea-saying/nay-saying)
or properties of the item itself (e.g., polarizing questions).
\item \code{bex}: Indicates the \emph{direction} of the extreme response bias. \code{bex > 0.5} suggests a bias
for producing ones more easily, while \code{bex < 0.5} suggests a bias towards zero.
