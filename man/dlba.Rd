\title{The density function \code{dlba} calculates the likelihood of observing a specific
reaction time \code{x} and response \code{response}, given the LBA parameters. It is
based on the formulation by Brown & Heathcote (2008), where the likelihood
is the product of the probability density of the winning accumulator finishing
at time \code{t = x - ndt} and the probability (survival function) that the losing
accumulator has not finished by time \code{t}. The density is normalized by
\code{(1 - pnegative)}, where \code{pnegative} is the probability that both drift rates
are non-positive, to account for the resampling process in \code{rlba}.}
